# huntsman

One crate, `huntsman-recon`. The current version lives in `src/`; the two legacy zip archives in the repository root and their extracted copies in `legacy/` are permanent read-only reference (see below).

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/` | The crate: library modules plus the `huntsman-recon` binary (`main.rs`). |
| `tests/` | Acceptance, CLI, local-HTTP and legacy-reference integration tests; `hibp_build.rs` (build-time key embedding rules); `android_ci.rs` (the CI workflow keeps the aarch64 Android cross-build and its artifact); plus `readme.rs` and `dispositions.rs`, which check this README and `docs/DISPOSITIONS.md` against the binary and `legacy/`. |
| `var/` | Artifacts written by `check` (`ledger.json`, `navigator.json`, `stix-bundle.json`). CI fails if `check` changes them. |
| `docs/` | `RECONSTRUCTION_2026-10-02.md` (decisions and falsification passes) and `DISPOSITIONS.md` (per-file accounting of every legacy file). |
| `.github/` | `workflows/ci.yml` (tests on Rust 1.87 and stable; aarch64 Android cross-build) and `actions/setup-ndk-aarch64` (NDK compiler and linker environment). |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Notable changes, Keep a Changelog format. |
| `legacy/` | Byte-identical extraction of both archives. Not part of the build. |
| `*.zip` (root) | The two legacy archives. Pinned by hash in `tests/legacy_reference.rs`; never delete, edit or move them. |

Local search, recorder and ledger, with a guarded fetch layer (egress policy, credential-origin rules, `fetch` and `keys` commands; `check` exercises egress, origin, placeholder and URL-redaction rules as gate 11, without a socket). A challenge page is not a hit. No paid source is called automatically; HIBP is an explicit opt-in library client. The ledger is a hash chain. A full terminate must name the tip. A verified claim is not an ATT&CK score.

```
cargo test
cargo run -- check                     # self-acceptance; regenerates var/*.json
cargo run -- verify var/ledger.json    # entries, admitted count, tip; non-zero if broken
cargo run -- search "brisbane port"    # built-in fixture
cargo run -- search "brisbane port" docs/
cargo run -- geo -27.4698,153.0251 -33.8688,151.2093
cargo run -- id "53 004 085 616"        # ABN/ACN/BSB, strict grouping
cargo run -- geohash -27.4698,153.0251 9
cargo run -- coarsen -27.4698,153.0251 # one decimal place, ~11 km
cargo run -- classify 200 "<html>just a moment cloudflare</html>"
cargo run -- keys keys.env               # mode 600; prints slot + fingerprint prefix, never the value
cargo run -- fetch https://example.com/  # guarded fetch; run `fetch` without a URL for options
```

`search` needs at least one term of two or more letters or digits (exit 64 otherwise). `search DIR` loads `.txt` and `.md` (any case) from that one directory. Challenge pages, non-UTF-8 files, files over 1 MiB, and symlinks are skipped and listed on stderr. An unreadable directory exits 66; it does not print `hits=0`.

Exit codes: 64 usage, 65 bad data or broken ledger, 66 unreadable input or unconfigured credential, 69 `fetch` got no response, 74 artifact write failure, 77 `fetch` refused the request (egress policy or malformed URL or redirect target). `check` uses 2–11 for its individual gates. Running the binary with no command runs `check`; `help`, `-h` and `--help` print the usage line.

`tests/readme.rs` runs every example above (except the internet `fetch`), checks that the examples and the CLI usage name the same commands, produces each documented exit code, and matches the gate range to `src/main.rs`.

`fetch URL` options (defaults in brackets):

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--body` | Print the response body after the status line. |
| `--allow-private` | Lift the egress policy (otherwise only public addresses are reachable; loopback, private, link-local and metadata addresses exit 77). |
| `--keys FILE` | Read credential slots from a `NAME=value` file (mode 600 or stricter, at most 64 KiB); slots it lacks fall back to the process environment. Without it, slots come from the environment only. |
| `--bearer SLOT` | Send slot `SLOT` as `Authorization: Bearer`. |
| `--header NAME=SLOT` | Send slot `SLOT` in header `NAME`. Only one of `--bearer`/`--header` per fetch. |
| `--max-redirects N` | Follow at most `N` redirects, 0–20 [5]. A credential is only sent to the origin it was approved for. |
| `--timeout SECS` | Per-request timeout, 1–600 [20]. |

Slot names are upper-case environment-variable names (`A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`; starting with a letter; at most 64 characters). Keys are read at run time only: from the environment, or from a file you name with `--keys` / `keys FILE`. No keys file is loaded implicitly; to use `~/.huntsman.env`, pass it explicitly (`--keys ~/.huntsman.env`, mode 600). Blank values and template placeholders (`insert_key_here`, `<your-key>`, `changeme`, `xxxx`) count as not configured. Output shows a 12-hex-digit fingerprint prefix, never a key value.

`classify` also prints the causal outcome and the source-health action (`outcome=bot_waf`, `action=backoff`). A 403 challenge page is a WAF, not a credential failure. A 200 alone is `inconclusive` until rows are parsed.

The refactor-overlay foundations from the uploaded zip are library modules: `source_outcome` (causal fetch outcome), `evidence_ancestry` (mirrors of one dump count once), `identity_resolution` (non-compensatory merge gate over ancestry), `termination` (fixed point vs bounds), `credential_origin` (found credentials are evidence, never authority), and `eval` (deterministic scoring, bootstrap, promote/hold verdict). `check` exercises them as gate 5.

Rebuilt monolith utilities: `au_id` (ABN, ACN, BSB), `geohash`, `confidence` (corroboration, ancestry-aware), `redact` (coordinate coarsening, secret scrubbing). `check` exercises them as gate 10.

See `docs/RECONSTRUCTION_2026-10-02.md`.

## Build and install

Toolchain: the crate's MSRV is Rust 1.87 (`rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`); CI tests Rust 1.87 and current stable. The owner's reference toolchain is Rust 1.98.0. The repository has no `rust-toolchain.toml`, so rustup uses your default toolchain.

On the device, in Termux (unverified on a handset):

```
pkg install rust clang   # ring (via rustls) needs a C compiler
cargo build --release --locked
./target/release/huntsman-recon check
```

Cross-build for Android aarch64 (what the `android-aarch64` CI job does, API level 24):

```
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
export TOOLCHAIN="$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin"
export CC_aarch64_linux_android="$TOOLCHAIN/aarch64-linux-android24-clang"
export AR_aarch64_linux_android="$TOOLCHAIN/llvm-ar"
export CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER="$CC_aarch64_linux_android"
HUNTSMAN_HIBP_NO_EMBED=1 cargo build --release --locked --target aarch64-linux-android
```

The reference NDK is 27.3.13750724. CI uses the runner's `ANDROID_NDK_LATEST_HOME` and does not pin an NDK version. Set `HUNTSMAN_HIBP_NO_EMBED=1` (CI does) for any binary that leaves your machine, so no key is embedded (see below).

### Downloads

Each push to `main` uploads a CI artifact named `huntsman-recon-aarch64-linux-android`: the binary plus its `.sha256`, kept for 14 days. Download it from the workflow run's page, or with `gh run download <run-id> -n huntsman-recon-aarch64-linux-android`. Check it with `sha256sum -c huntsman-recon-aarch64-linux-android.sha256`, then copy it into Termux's home directory and `chmod +x` it.

The current workflow publishes no GitHub Release. The `main-<sha7>` pre-releases on the Releases page predate the reconstruction and ship the legacy `hse` binary, not `huntsman-recon`. Release policy: only pre-releases (`main-<sha7>` plus a rolling `latest`); a stable release needs the owner's explicit approval and is never automatic.

## Opt-in HIBP library

`huntsman_recon::hibp` ports the HIBP branch onto this single blocking crate;
it does not restore the async monolith or modify either legacy snapshot.
`HibpClient::production(Auth::ApiKey(key), HibpConfig::default())` uses the
guarded `UreqTransport` and the existing fetch boundary without following redirects.
An injected `Arc<dyn Transport + Send + Sync>` supports offline tests.

Read endpoints: breach catalogue, individual/latest breach, data classes,
breached accounts (including options and local SHA-1 k-anonymity lookup), pastes,
verified-domain breaches, subscribed domains, subscription status, all three
stealer-log searches, and free SHA-1/NTLM Pwned Passwords ranges with padding.
Domain verification and email-sending endpoints are intentionally excluded.
Keys never go to public or password endpoints. Entitlements are checked against a
cached subscription response; missing flags fail closed. Keyed calls share a
10/minute sliding window (`HIBP_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=0` disables local pacing).
429 retries are bounded; a server delay above `max_retry_after` returns immediately
instead of retrying sooner than requested. Truncated or malformed bodies are errors.

Key precedence: `HIBP_API_KEY`, caller's `HUNTSMAN_HIBP_KEY` slot (or that environment
variable), private `~/.config/hibp/api_key`, then optional build-time embedding.
Blank/placeholders are ignored; files are bounded and symlinks refused.
Personal builds can embed a key only into Cargo's `OUT_DIR` (and therefore the
binary); do not distribute such binaries. `CI`, `HSE_RELEASE`, or
`HUNTSMAN_HIBP_NO_EMBED` being set disables embedding. Runtime keys still work.

`hibp::oauth` implements discovery, public registration, PKCE S256 authorization,
code exchange and refresh for the documented MCP resource, **not REST v3 bearer
authentication**. The caller must verify the returned state before exchanging a
code. Authorization-server URLs must stay on HIBP's HTTPS origin. Linux/Termux
randomness comes from `/dev/urandom`. Token stores support memory or bounded,
atomic mode-600 files. Debug/errors omit keys, tokens and upstream error bodies.
All integration evidence here is offline fake-transport testing; live HIBP and
Termux handset acceptance remain unverified.
