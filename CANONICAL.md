# Canonical Huntsman

One operator repository. One crate. One installed binary.

- Repository: `EmmmmDeee/Huntsman-Search-Engine-HSE-Termux-Android-Aarch64-Rust-`
- Binary: `huntsman-recon`
- Target: Termux Android `aarch64-linux-android`, no root
- Identity module: `src/repository_identity.rs`
- Value normaliser: `src/canonical.rs`

`hse` is the legacy monolith. It is not a second current engine.

Other copies are not this engine:

- `huntsman-rcvf` is a divergent experiment. Do not install it over this binary.
- `Huntsman-` is not the operator binary.
- `HSE-BLE-API-` is the BLE radar APK. It stays a separate runtime because it is not a Termux crate.
- `huntsman-bse-radar` is the Termux seam to that radar. It is not a second search engine.

SeekNow on this binary is `huntsman-recon seeknow search KIND VALUE --fast-only`. It reads `HUNTSMAN_SEEKNOW_KEY`. It does not read `SEEKNOW_COOKIE`.

No repository was deleted.
